# Research of interest and popularity about Software Vulnerabilities on Twitter

This project intends to research the tweets that are referring to specific Vulnerability entries
of National Vulnerability Database's official registrations
(NVD), investigating through statistical and NLP methods the interest of users for specific companies,
products and Software Vulnerability Categories.

The data that we analyze comes from NVD Data Feeds and Twitter API.

The notebooks of this project are part of  my thesis development, under the supervision of Prof. Eleftherios Angelis, Konstantinos Charmanas and Konstantinos Georgiou.

Please note that Markdown text is written in Greek.

As the project is under development, new notebooks will be uploaded in this repository.
